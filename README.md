*DESCRIPTION OF THIS TASK*: This project is a simple and user-friendly E-Learning platform called LearnHub, made using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Although it's not exactly an interactive quiz app, it still fits the idea of an educational task. The goal of the platform is to give users a space where they can explore courses, watch learning videos, and track their progress easily. The homepage (index.html) welcomes users with a clean layout. It has a title, a short message encouraging users to learn anytime and anywhere, and a button that takes them to the list of available courses. When users click to see the courses, they’re taken to the courses.html page. Here, they’ll find a list of courses shown in card format. Each course card has a name, a short description, and a “View Course” link that opens more details about the course. For example, the platform currently lists an HTML & CSS course and a JavaScript Essentials course. When users click on a course, it takes them to the course-detail.html page, where they can actually begin learning. This page includes the course title, a short description, and a YouTube video embedded right into the page so users can start watching the lesson directly. One of the useful features here is the progress tracker, which visually shows how much of the course has been completed using a progress bar. At first, it shows 40%, but with the help of the JavaScript file (script.js), the progress updates automatically to 60% after a few seconds. This is just a demo to show how progress tracking could work. In a real project, this could be connected to the user’s activity or video completion. The JavaScript used here is very basic, but it shows how you can add dynamic changes to a webpage, like updating the progress bar in real time. The design of the platform is kept clean and easy to navigate thanks to the CSS file (style.css). The header has a bold blue background, and the text is styled clearly. The courses are displayed using a flexible layout that adjusts well on different screen sizes, so it works on both mobile and desktop. Buttons and links are styled to stand out, and the overall color theme is bright and educational. The video area and progress bar are also nicely spaced so users can focus on the content. Overall, this project does a great job of showing the basic structure of an online learning platform. It includes multiple pages, styled content, embedded media, and a touch of interactivity with JavaScript. While it doesn’t have quizzes yet, the structure makes it easy to add more features like interactive questions, certificates, or user logins later. It’s a great example of how to build a clean and functional front-end educational tool, and it covers all the basics that a beginner developer should know.
